1
00:00:00,099 --> 00:00:00,602
Hello!

2
00:00:00,804 --> 00:00:01,811
My name is Neil

3
00:00:01,912 --> 00:00:03,017
and I want to talk with you

4
00:00:03,117 --> 00:00:04,928
about electoral reform in the UK.

5
00:00:05,028 --> 00:00:06,841
So, what is that?

6
00:00:06,942 --> 00:00:09,155
Well I will start by speaking

7
00:00:09,256 --> 00:00:11,065
about the current system in the UK

8
00:00:11,166 --> 00:00:13,178
which is called FPTP.

9
00:00:13,279 --> 00:00:16,497
In the UK there are 659 constituencies.

10
00:00:16,699 --> 00:00:21,526
Each constituency equates to
one seat each in parliament.

11
00:00:21,626 --> 00:00:24,442
In every constituency each party that
is big enough

12
00:00:24,543 --> 00:00:28,567
sends one candidate each to
represent that party.

13
00:00:28,668 --> 00:00:33,797
The members of the constituency
vote for their favourite candidate

14
00:00:33,898 --> 00:00:37,816
and the one that has the most
votes wins the seat.

15
00:00:37,917 --> 00:00:41,738
That system seems very simple and suitable.

16
00:00:41,839 --> 00:00:44,954
Each constituency has one representative

17
00:00:45,054 --> 00:00:48,170
who in theory best represents the issues

18
00:00:48,271 --> 00:00:50,383
of its members in parliament.

19
00:00:50,483 --> 00:00:52,595
However it doesn't really work like that.

20
00:00:52,695 --> 00:00:56,014
People don't really vote for an individual person

21
00:00:56,114 --> 00:00:59,531
but for a party and even, indirectly,

22
00:00:59,632 --> 00:01:01,643
for the leader of that party.

23
00:01:01,744 --> 00:01:06,070
And rather than wanting that person to
represent their region

24
00:01:06,170 --> 00:01:10,096
the influence in the national
decisions are more important.

25
00:01:10,298 --> 00:01:12,844
In 2015 the UK had an election.

26
00:01:12,944 --> 00:01:16,263
The left pie chart shows the proportion of seats

27
00:01:16,364 --> 00:01:18,677
of every party in parliament.

28
00:01:18,778 --> 00:01:23,607
There the blue conservatives have
a very clear victory

29
00:01:23,708 --> 00:01:25,921
with more than half of the seats.

30
00:01:26,122 --> 00:01:30,444
The pie chart on the right shows
the proportion of the actual votes.

31
00:01:30,544 --> 00:01:33,461
That shows that the UK isn't so unilateral

32
00:01:33,562 --> 00:01:35,070
as it seems according to the seats.

33
00:01:35,171 --> 00:01:38,392
The conservatives have more representation

34
00:01:38,492 --> 00:01:40,405
than they deserve according to the votes.

35
00:01:40,607 --> 00:01:43,924
That is a result of the fact that many votes
are effectively thrown away

36
00:01:44,024 --> 00:01:45,534
in the current system.

37
00:01:45,634 --> 00:01:48,551
For example, imagine I lived in this region,

38
00:01:48,741 --> 00:01:49,848
Haltemprice and Howden.

39
00:01:49,949 --> 00:01:53,268
There, the conservatives always win

40
00:01:53,368 --> 00:01:58,600
and the seat hasn't changed
since the election in 1836.

41
00:01:58,802 --> 00:02:02,321
That is called a ‘safe seat’ because it never changes.

42
00:02:02,422 --> 00:02:05,944
If I was a supporter of the
Labour party in that region,

43
00:02:06,045 --> 00:02:07,452
it would hardly be worth voting

44
00:02:07,552 --> 00:02:10,367
and in a way my vote would be thrown away.

45
00:02:10,568 --> 00:02:14,590
Even more so, for example if I preferred
the Green party in that region,

46
00:02:14,691 --> 00:02:17,307
maybe I would vote for the Labour party anyway,

47
00:02:17,407 --> 00:02:20,825
because I know that the Green party
has no chance.

48
00:02:21,035 --> 00:02:25,560
Maybe Labour would be the only ones
who could stand against the Conservatives.

49
00:02:25,661 --> 00:02:28,377
That is called a tactical vote

50
00:02:28,477 --> 00:02:30,893
and that happens a lot in the UK.

51
00:02:31,096 --> 00:02:33,208
Instead of voting for their favourite party,

52
00:02:33,309 --> 00:02:36,528
people have to vote for the one
who has a chance of winning.

53
00:02:36,629 --> 00:02:40,951
In that way the small parties don't grow easily

54
00:02:41,152 --> 00:02:43,968
and the politics can only change very slowly.

55
00:02:44,068 --> 00:02:46,984
So that's why the Electoral Reform Society exists.

56
00:02:47,410 --> 00:02:51,533
That society estimates that in fact 59% of the seats

57
00:02:51,633 --> 00:02:54,046
are that kind that can't change.

58
00:02:54,147 --> 00:02:57,970
They suggest another voting system called STV,

59
00:02:58,174 --> 00:03:00,690
or Single Transferable Vote.

60
00:03:00,791 --> 00:03:01,998
In that system,

61
00:03:02,099 --> 00:03:04,013
the constituencies are made bigger

62
00:03:04,113 --> 00:03:07,734
and instead of only electing
one candidate from each constituency

63
00:03:07,834 --> 00:03:10,350
you elect maybe 3 or 4.

64
00:03:10,450 --> 00:03:13,869
The representatives of each constituency are elected

65
00:03:13,970 --> 00:03:16,988
according to some kind of system
of proportional representation.

66
00:03:17,089 --> 00:03:19,199
So, we'll see how it works by an example.

67
00:03:19,300 --> 00:03:22,518
Firt we'll do the election with the current system

68
00:03:22,619 --> 00:03:23,925
for one constituency.

69
00:03:24,025 --> 00:03:27,143
So, in the constituency
there are these three candidates:

70
00:03:27,244 --> 00:03:30,361
Albus Dumbledore from the Gryffindor party

71
00:03:30,462 --> 00:03:33,282
Filius Flitwick from Ravenclaw

72
00:03:33,383 --> 00:03:35,998
and Lord Voldemort from Slytherine.

73
00:03:36,098 --> 00:03:40,122
So, the most important issue going on
during this fictional election

74
00:03:40,223 --> 00:03:43,943
is should we imprison and torture muggles,

75
00:03:44,044 --> 00:03:47,365
or would it be better to make friends with them.

76
00:03:47,465 --> 00:03:50,382
The Slytherine party supports torture

77
00:03:50,482 --> 00:03:52,697
but the other two parties want to make friends.

78
00:03:52,797 --> 00:03:55,010
So, here's the result of this ballot

79
00:03:55,111 --> 00:03:57,924
according to the current system of FPTP.

80
00:03:58,025 --> 00:03:59,433
Dumbledore has 50 votes,

81
00:03:59,533 --> 00:04:01,141
Flitwick has 40

82
00:04:01,241 --> 00:04:03,655
and Voldemort has 54.

83
00:04:03,856 --> 00:04:06,672
So in this system the Slytherine party wins

84
00:04:06,772 --> 00:04:08,986
because it has the most votes.

85
00:04:09,191 --> 00:04:13,920
Now, from that region, in parliament,
100% of the representation

86
00:04:14,024 --> 00:04:16,137
supports imprisoning muggles

87
00:04:16,238 --> 00:04:20,666
even though actually 63% voted for parties

88
00:04:20,766 --> 00:04:22,878
who were against that.

89
00:04:22,978 --> 00:04:26,901
You could imagine that a similar thing
could happen in every other constituency.

90
00:04:27,002 --> 00:04:30,720
In the end the UK could become 100% Slytherin

91
00:04:30,821 --> 00:04:33,939
and we'd immediately start torturing the poor muggles,

92
00:04:34,144 --> 00:04:39,265
even though according to the amount of votes
support of that would be in the minority.

93
00:04:39,466 --> 00:04:42,783
Now we can imagine the results
according to the STV system.

94
00:04:42,884 --> 00:04:47,009
In this system the constituencies are three times as big

95
00:04:47,110 --> 00:04:52,037
and the candidates from the 2 neighbouring
constituencies join the ballot.

96
00:04:52,241 --> 00:04:55,660
The ballot papers in STV are different.

97
00:04:55,761 --> 00:05:00,891
In FPTP the voter just puts one cross

98
00:05:00,993 --> 00:05:02,905
on the candidate that they want.

99
00:05:03,006 --> 00:05:07,233
In STV you can put a number next to every candidate

100
00:05:07,441 --> 00:05:09,855
to order them according to preference.

101
00:05:09,956 --> 00:05:13,276
So first we'll only consider
the results for the candidates

102
00:05:13,583 --> 00:05:15,494
who received a 1 next to their name,

103
00:05:15,595 --> 00:05:19,823
so that is those who are the
favourite candidates.

104
00:05:19,924 --> 00:05:21,635
The results are as follows.

105
00:05:21,736 --> 00:05:24,652
The proportion for each party is the same.

106
00:05:24,854 --> 00:05:27,973
Voldemort still has the most votes

107
00:05:28,073 --> 00:05:31,595
because everyone in Slytherine was afraid to vote
for another candidate.

108
00:05:31,796 --> 00:05:36,827
We have to pick three of those
candidates for this region,

109
00:05:36,928 --> 00:05:40,752
but instead of picking the ones with
the most votes

110
00:05:40,955 --> 00:05:45,986
we pick the ones who have at least
a certain quota of the votes.

111
00:05:46,087 --> 00:05:49,104
So to decide what is the quota,

112
00:05:49,205 --> 00:05:51,218
we will do the following calculation:

113
00:05:51,318 --> 00:05:56,043
The number of votes divided by
the number of seats plus one.

114
00:05:56,143 --> 00:05:59,694
In this case the quota is 36.

115
00:05:59,795 --> 00:06:03,314
So Voldemort already has enough votes

116
00:06:03,414 --> 00:06:05,628
to reach the 36 needed

117
00:06:05,728 --> 00:06:08,644
and he immediately becomes the first
member of parliament.

118
00:06:08,745 --> 00:06:12,666
That makes sense because he already has
more than a third of the votes.

119
00:06:12,862 --> 00:06:15,775
However Voldemort only needed 36 votes

120
00:06:15,875 --> 00:06:19,094
and the extra 18 were completely superfluous.

121
00:06:19,195 --> 00:06:22,413
Instead of just throwing those votes away

122
00:06:22,514 --> 00:06:26,339
we will give them to the second choice of the voter.

123
00:06:26,540 --> 00:06:29,556
But because those votes already won a seat,

124
00:06:29,758 --> 00:06:33,277
we will lower the value of the transferred vote.

125
00:06:33,378 --> 00:06:36,798
We will take the second choice from all of the 54 votes

126
00:06:36,899 --> 00:06:42,432
but the value will be divided by the proportion
of the superfluous votes.

127
00:06:42,533 --> 00:06:47,866
In this case the superfluous votes are 18 out of 54,

128
00:06:48,072 --> 00:06:49,983
and that is one third of the votes.

129
00:06:50,084 --> 00:06:52,901
Nine of the people who voted for Voldemort

130
00:06:53,002 --> 00:06:55,317
had Malfoy as a second choice,

131
00:06:55,521 --> 00:06:58,740
and the remaining 45 had Bellatrix.

132
00:06:58,840 --> 00:07:02,662
So we'll give 15 votes to Bellatrix

133
00:07:02,862 --> 00:07:04,671
and three to Malfoy.

134
00:07:04,772 --> 00:07:06,883
And Voldemort disappears from the list.

135
00:07:06,984 --> 00:07:09,698
The points for the second seat are now like this.

136
00:07:09,900 --> 00:07:14,123
Now nobody has enough votes to reach the quota.

137
00:07:14,224 --> 00:07:17,646
So we'll get rid of the one who has the least

138
00:07:17,747 --> 00:07:21,771
and we'll share their votes with their next choice.

139
00:07:21,871 --> 00:07:26,296
In this case the lowest is Malfoy
who has three points.

140
00:07:26,397 --> 00:07:31,425
The ones who voted for him preferred
Bellatrix in third place,

141
00:07:31,526 --> 00:07:33,738
because obivously they want someone from Slytherine.

142
00:07:33,838 --> 00:07:35,748
So she'll get his points.

143
00:07:35,950 --> 00:07:37,458
And he'll disappear from the list.

144
00:07:37,659 --> 00:07:39,672
The same happens for Gilderoy.

145
00:07:39,875 --> 00:07:43,197
His voters preferred Flitwick in second place.

146
00:07:43,297 --> 00:07:46,615
He has four points which will go to Flitwick.

147
00:07:46,716 --> 00:07:48,726
And he disappears from the list.

148
00:07:48,826 --> 00:07:51,240
Nobody has enough points yet

149
00:07:51,442 --> 00:07:54,460
and now McGonagall is in last place.

150
00:07:54,561 --> 00:07:57,275
Her voters obviously wanted someone from Gryffindor

151
00:07:57,376 --> 00:08:00,999
and so prefer Dumbledore
as their next choice.

152
00:08:01,099 --> 00:08:03,613
The five votes for McGonagall go to him

153
00:08:03,714 --> 00:08:05,021
and she disappears from the list.

154
00:08:05,121 --> 00:08:06,832
Now it's Weasley's turn.

155
00:08:06,932 --> 00:08:09,144
His 15 votes go to Dumbledore

156
00:08:09,244 --> 00:08:10,954
and he disappears from the list.

157
00:08:11,154 --> 00:08:15,477
Finally Dumbledore has enough votes
to reach the quota.

158
00:08:15,678 --> 00:08:18,894
14 of those votes were superfluous,

159
00:08:18,994 --> 00:08:22,919
so we'll transfer the votes to
the next preferred candidate.

160
00:08:23,020 --> 00:08:27,040
That is Flitwick, because the ones who wanted Gryffindor

161
00:08:27,246 --> 00:08:30,263
would surely prefer anything
than have someone from Slyherine.

162
00:08:30,364 --> 00:08:33,986
28% of his votes were superfluous,

163
00:08:34,086 --> 00:08:37,407
so we'll give 28% of 50 to Flitwick.

164
00:08:37,508 --> 00:08:40,624
That makes 14 votes for Flitwick.

165
00:08:40,725 --> 00:08:43,137
And Dumbledore disappears from the list.

166
00:08:43,238 --> 00:08:45,149
Now Flitwick reaches the quota

167
00:08:45,250 --> 00:08:48,666
and becomes the third and final
member of parliament for that region.

168
00:08:48,767 --> 00:08:50,880
So the three winners are:

169
00:08:50,980 --> 00:08:52,188
Voldemort from Slytherine

170
00:08:52,289 --> 00:08:53,595
Dumbledore from Gryffindor

171
00:08:53,695 --> 00:08:55,307
and Flitwick from Ravenclaw

172
00:08:55,508 --> 00:08:58,124
Now we have one candidate from each party.

173
00:08:58,225 --> 00:09:02,045
That nicely reflects the fact that
almost a third of the votes

174
00:09:02,146 --> 00:09:04,259
went to each of the three parties.

175
00:09:04,359 --> 00:09:07,575
The system proposed by the electoral reform society

176
00:09:07,676 --> 00:09:11,800
has a big advantage over a system
of pure proportional representation

177
00:09:12,001 --> 00:09:16,129
and that is that you can still vote for a local candidate.

178
00:09:16,229 --> 00:09:20,455
In that way you can still have someone
who you have a connection with.

179
00:09:20,555 --> 00:09:23,774
It's also good for independent candidates

180
00:09:23,874 --> 00:09:27,008
who are popular only in one region.

181
00:09:27,109 --> 00:09:31,130
The advantages over the current system of FPTP

182
00:09:31,228 --> 00:09:35,454
are that it completely gets rid of
the need to vote tactically

183
00:09:35,551 --> 00:09:38,768
and you can vote for who you actually want

184
00:09:38,970 --> 00:09:42,289
without risking your vote being thrown away.

185
00:09:42,490 --> 00:09:45,505
It also introduces some kind of
proportional representation

186
00:09:45,606 --> 00:09:48,724
without completely overthrowing the current system.

187
00:09:48,824 --> 00:09:51,336
The disadvantages could be

188
00:09:51,437 --> 00:09:53,649
that it's a bit more complicated to understand.

189
00:09:53,950 --> 00:09:57,774
However I think that you don't
really need to understand

190
00:09:57,880 --> 00:09:59,791
how the votes are counted to vote

191
00:09:59,892 --> 00:10:02,405
because the only thing you need to do

192
00:10:02,506 --> 00:10:06,428
is put the candidates in order of preference

193
00:10:06,528 --> 00:10:08,539
and that is easy to understand.

194
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:11,555
You could argue that the current system itself

195
00:10:11,655 --> 00:10:14,572
is very complicated for the voters.

196
00:10:14,673 --> 00:10:16,888
Because if they want to vote well

197
00:10:16,988 --> 00:10:20,509
they have to not only consider who they like most

198
00:10:20,609 --> 00:10:24,030
but also who has a chance
of winning in their consistuency.

199
00:10:24,131 --> 00:10:26,142
So if you like the idea,

200
00:10:26,143 --> 00:10:29,865
